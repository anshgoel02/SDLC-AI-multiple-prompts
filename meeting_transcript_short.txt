Date: 2025-05-30

LI, ANGELA 0:02
We are kicking off a new platform called the R&D Sensory Insights Platform to centralize sensory testing data and make historical trend analysis possible.

SHARMA, DEEPAK 0:18
Today the data sits in spreadsheets and shared drives, so it takes days to find past results.

LI, ANGELA 0:34
This is a greenfield project; we don't have an existing system for this.

SOONG, JENN 0:50
Primary workflow: intake test requests from R&D and Marketing, then assign tests to external sensory agencies.

LI, ANGELA 1:05
After tests, vendors upload raw results; we will standardize the data and publish insights in Power BI dashboards.

SHARMA, DEEPAK 1:22
For authentication, internal users must use Azure AD.

SOONG, JENN 1:35
Assumption: vendors will access an external portal we provide.

LI, ANGELA 1:48
Constraint: data refresh should run nightly.

SHARMA, DEEPAK 2:02
Risk: vendor data formats are inconsistent and may require extra cleansing.

LI, ANGELA 2:20
Out of scope for phase 1 is ERP integration.

SOONG, JENN 2:34
Open question: which vendor portal solution do we use or build?

LI, ANGELA 2:46
Open question: what SLAs apply for test turnaround time?
